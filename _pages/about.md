Hi! I'm Karun :)

<div style="text-align: justify;">

I am a <b>Computer Science</b> graduate from the <b>University of Delhi</b>. I have been working on the <b>backend side of online systems</b> for the past two years now. <br><br>

Currently, I am a backend Software Engineer at <b>qplum</b>, a fin-tech start up based out of New Jersey. Here, I am involved with maintaining and developing features for the various <b>microservices</b> which power <b> qplum's robo advisory</b> product. I have also been heavily involved in streamlining various aspects of qplum's marketing as well as internal trading processes in the system.<br><br>

I enjoy server side development and experimenting with different <b>system design architectures</b>. Right now I am a <b>full time Rubyist</b>, but I also have had an immersive experience in <b>C++, Python, C and Javascript</b>. 
<br><br>

Lately, I have been interested to explore more about <b>Distributed Systems</b> and designing systems for scale. In my free time, I like to <b>solve Algorithmic problems</b> on various websites as well as learn more about Japanese culture.<br><br>
